I am currently developing my own AVR development, arduino like. I want to make
it a industrially made PCB, and I want it I am 
certainly not the first one doing this (or even in the first thousand), and
some would probably say "Niels, this is a totally pointless exercise, why
don't you go to something else"

And maybe it is, but who are they to tell me what to do? I have some issues
with the arduino in its standard configuration, where the most irritating of these
are the downright stupid design decision of a pinspacing incompatible with
a standard perforated protoboard. And they are expensive, unless you go with 
an imported clone.

But I go the idea in [this episode of the EEVBlog](http://www.eevblog.com/2012/07/03/eevblog-302-electronics-beginner-advice/),
where Dave agrees with a viewer, that building a kit is a good learning experience.
Mind you, he is probably talking somehting more advanced than yet another 
Arduino clone, but this has the added advantage of giving me a piece of 
experimenting equipment that I need.

## Design goals:

* DIY friendly
* Programmable from the Arduino IDE
* As cheap as possible.

In the next couple of weeks, I will go through the process of designing the
Eigthtuino.

I am currently at my second prototype, which, confusingly, is called
the eightuino, rev1. It will take some time before the blog series 
will reach this far, but here is a spoiler (yes, I now, it is a bit wonky
in the construction, that is what you get when you solder with a hangover):
